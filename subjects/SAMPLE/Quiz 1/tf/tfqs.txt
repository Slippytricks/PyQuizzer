Type each T/F question on it's own line
Answers to T/F questions must be on the same line(in file) as the question
Never change the tfcs.txt file
Keep note of question number
This is question 5
This is q 6
The line the question is on is the same as the line the answer is on(tfas.txt)
This answer to this q is on line 8 of the tfas.txt file
This is q 9
Leave one blank line at the end of each file
Adding questions to both MC and TF files is exactly the same
Answers to each MCquestion are on separate files, one answer file per question
Every single one of these T/F questions will be True
